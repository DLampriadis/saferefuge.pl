A modular unit that can be used as a temporary living space for those who will be rebuilding Ukraine once the war ends. The project will be developed through participatory processes, in consideration of the community needs and demands of the local climate. In collaboration with TU Delft, we are designing transitional housing units adapted to climate and social needs to be sent to Ukraine after the war. We want to provide shelter for those rebuilding the country/internal migrants.

**why?** Existing solutions are not suitable for the cold climate with harsh winters that the shetler will need to operate in. The users group is also specific - it is likely that the unit will host reunited families and extended families, not a group of strangers. We feel that for an adequate response, learning from the residents of Ukraine in a participatory process is necessary
