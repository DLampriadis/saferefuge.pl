title: Adaptive Reuse

A database of vacant buildings and strategies for their adaptation to housing, education, and related functions. We are primarily targeting small and medium-sized cities in Poland that are not in the spotlight but currently face a large influx of people. We hope in a later step, the solutions we propose could also inspire change in other European cities. We are looking for strategies to adapt these abandoned buildings in cities in Poland into flats, workplaces and other needed functions to support sustainable development and avoid ghettoisation.

**why?** At this moment of rapid change, we need to think of systemic solutions and a strategy for upgrading the cities in a longer perspective with adequate housing, urban infrastructure and opportunities for residents. We hope our effort, time, and help with finding resources for the investments can encourage solutions that will be sustainable from the environmental, social and economic point of view.
