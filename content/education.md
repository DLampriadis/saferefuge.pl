We are already discussing other ideas that our professional network could address in the future, including educational matters. We want to support the cities, from the design side, in establishing safe and sustainable communities through research-based solutions, which learn from mistakes and good practices of projects implemented elsewhere in the world. In collaboration with the Kiev KNUCA student scientific association, we bring together lecturers and practicing architects from different countries in the creation of a specialised online course for Ukrainian students on topics related to rebuilding their country. We are also organising access to libraries and software licences for them.
